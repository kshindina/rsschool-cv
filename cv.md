### Code example

**Codewars:** If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.  

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).  

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

```
function solution(number){
  
  let sum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        if ((i % 3 == 0) || (i % 5 == 0)) {
            sum += i;
        }
      
    }
  
  return sum;
}

```
